In this project,  we investigated the microbiome of WWT to build MicW2Graph, an open-source knowledge graph (KG) that integrates metagenomic and  metatranscriptomic information with their biological context, including biological processes, environmental and phenotypic  features, chemical compounds, and additional metadata. We developed a workflow to collect meta-omics datasets from MGnify and  infer potential interactions among microorganisms through microbial association networks (MANs). MicW2Graph enables the  investigation of research questions related to WWT, focusing on aspects such as microbial connections, community memberships,  and potential ecological functions.
